## Why use videos
The possibility of reading a Comic Book by simply watching a video will allow the user to be **hands-free**, because he or she will not have to hold a phone/tablet or press a button/screen to change the pages.
That will also allow the reading by **people with disabilities**.
## Features (and Packages)
- Extract Comic Books in .CBR and .CBZ compressed format ([win-7zip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/win-7zip)+[cross-zip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-unzip)) and PDF files ([pdfjs-dist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdfjs-dist))
- Divides each page ([sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp)) in frames containing the current section and the beginning of the next, to prevent speech baloons from being truncated between frames
- Use OCR ([tesseract.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tesseract.js)) to get the amount of text on each frame and calculate the ideal time for automatic transition
- The frame sequence is also saved in .JPG files, for manual transition

## Availability
All the features described are already functional, but the code needs some refactoring before a first public release.
