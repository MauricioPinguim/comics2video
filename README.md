# comics2video
Converts Comic Book files to videos to be watched on TV/Video players.

The possibility of reading a Comic Book by watching a video allows the user to be **hands-free** (no need to hold a phone or press a button/screen to change the pages) and also allow the reading by **people with disabilities**.

## How it works
> Example using Whiz Comics #34 (1942) - Fawcett Publications (Public Domain)

```

Or provide the path+file as a parameter:
```sh
node comics2video ./path/myComicBook.cbr
```

If the parameter is a folder, all files will be processed.

### Option C: As a Node.js module
Fisrt run a **npm install** in the comics2video root folder. After that, in your project root folder:
```sh
npm install ./pathToComics2video
```
Then use:
```javascript
const comics2video = require('comics2video'); // Local installation, not available in npmjs.com yet

const source = './path/myComicBook.cbr'; // Or folder containing the Comic Book files

const userParameters = {
	generateVideo : true,
	ocrEnabled: true,
	contentProfile: 'complex',
	readingSpeed: 'normal',
	logLevel: 5
}; // userParameters is optional, see default values in the next section

await comics2video.process(source, userParameters);
```

### User Parameters
| Name | How to set | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| generateVideo | boolean | true | If false, only the image frames will be generated |
| ocrEnabled | boolean | true | If false, disables OCR and uses a fixed duration in all frames
| contentProfile | string:<br/>'simple', 'complex' | 'complex' | Changes how OCR calculates each frame duration:<br/>â€¢ 'simple' : Ideal for Comics for kids, art with few details<br />â€¢ 'complex' : For Superhero or Comics with detailed art
| readingSpeed | string:<br/> 'slow', 'normal', 'fast' | 'normal' | Also changes how OCR calculates duration:<br/>â€¢ 'slow' : Ideal for Kids or reading in foreign language<br />â€¢ 'normal' : Normal reading speed<br />â€¢ 'fast' : For speed reading
| logLevel | number:<br />1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | 5 | From 1 to 5, how much information will be printed in logs:<br/>1 : Basic information, 5 : Detailed log

### Using the generated files
For each comic book processed, a folder with the same name will be created, containing:
- The video file in .MP4 format
	- Just open it in the TV/Video player of your choice, like a regular video
- A subfolder named 'Images' with all the frames in .JPG format
	- That can also be opened in modern TVs, advance each frame/page manually using the remote control
