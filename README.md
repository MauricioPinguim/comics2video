## Why use videos
The possibility of reading a Comic Book by simply watching a video will allow the user to be **hands-free**, because he or she will not have to hold a phone/tablet or press a button/screen to change the pages.
That will also allow the reading by **people with disabilities**.

## Installation and usage
1. Git Clone or Download comics2video files from this repository ![Clone or download code](./docs/images/code.png)
2. Install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
3. To install the dependencies, run the following command in the comics2video root folder:

```sh
npm install
```
###Using as a standalone app
Place the Comic Book files in the **comics_files folder** and run:
```sh
node comics2video
```

Or provide the path+file as a parameter:
```sh
node comics2video ./path/myComicBook.cbr
```

Or the folder containing the comic book files:
```sh
node comics2video ./pathWithComicBooks
```

###Using as a Node.js module
Make sure to install the comics2video dependencies first, then use:
```javascript
const comics2video = require('comics2video');

const source = './path/myComicBook.cbr';

await comics2video.process(source);
```

###Using the generated files
For each comic book processed, a folder with the same name will be created, containing:
- The video file in .MP4 format. Just open it in the TV/Video player of your choice, like a regular video
- A subfolder named 'Images' with all the frames in .JPG format. That can also be opened in modern TVs, advance each frame/page manually using the remote control
